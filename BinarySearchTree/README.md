# Binary Search Tree (Self Study)
#### By Joshua Bone, 10/7/2016


### Overview
This is a console-based implementation of a Binary Search Tree. The Node class includes recursive methods to insert and find nodes, as well as print the pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals. It is also capable of printing a crude but accurate output representing the entirety of the tree itself. The NodeTest class implements one example.

##### Notes
Begin the program by running the NoteTest class.

##### Sample Output
```
15(12(10(__,11),__),18(16(__,17),20))
15, 12, 10, 11, 18, 16, 17, 20, 
10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 
11, 10, 12, 17, 16, 20, 18, 15,
```
