# Caesar's Cipher (Skill Distillery Project, Week 2)
#### By Joshua Bone, 10/10/2016



### Overview
This program implements a simple 'secret code' supposedly used by Julius Caesar, where each letter in a message is shifted by an integer 'key'. For example, if the key is 4, the letter 'a' becomes 'e', the letter 'y' becomes 'c', etc. 

### User Story #1:
The user is prompted to decide if they are encrypting or decrypting a message.

### User Story #2:
The user is prompted to enter the message the want encrypted or decrypted.

### User Story #3:
The user is prompted to enter the integer 'key'. The program then displays the encrypted or decrypted message.

##### Notes
Begin the game by running the CipherTest class.
