# Project Euler Solutions (Problems 1-10)

### [Problem 1] (PE001.java) - Multiples of 3 and 5
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
```

### [Problem 2] (PE002.java) - Even Fibonacci numbers
###### Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of the even valued Fibonacci numbers < 4 million: 4613732
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 4613732
```

### [Problem 3] (PE003.java) - Largest prime factor
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
```

### [Problem 4] (PE004.java) - Largest palindrome product
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
```

### [Problem 5] (PE005.java) - Smallest multiple
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
