# Project Euler Solutions (Problems 1-10)

### [Problem 1] (PE001.java) - Multiples of 3 and 5
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
```
