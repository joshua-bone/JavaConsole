# Project Euler Solutions (Problems 1-10)

### Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
###### Problem Statement
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

###### Solution Output [(View Code)] (PE001.java)
```
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 10: 23
Sum of multiples of 3 or 5 that are less than 1000: 233168
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 233168
```


### Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
###### Problem Statement
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

> 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Prime factors of 13195: [5, 7, 13, 29]
Prime factors of 600851475143: [71, 839, 1471, 6857]
Confirmed answer from Project Euler: 6857
```

### Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product
###### Problem Statement
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

###### Solution Output [(View Code)] (PE004.java)
```
found: 580085 (995x583)
found: 906609 (993x913)
Largest palindrome found: 906609
Verified answer from Project Euler: 906609
```
