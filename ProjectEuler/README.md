# Project Euler Java Solutions (Self Study)
#### Ongoing project by Joshua Bone



### Overview (from the [Project Euler] [pepage] home page )
 
> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.


##### Notes
Each problem is contained in its own class named "PExxx.java" where xxx = 001 for the first problem, 002 for the 2nd, etc. All methods within each of these classes are static. Occasionally I have created certain "helper" classes containing reusable code for some of the more common themes (such as prime numbers). 

##### Example (Solution to Problem 5)
> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

```
Test case (1-10):
Factors: 2·2·2·3·3·5·7
Calculated answer: 2520

Stated problem (1-20):
Factors: 2·2·2·2·3·3·5·7·11·13·17·19
Calculated answer: 232792560

Verified answer from Project Euler: 232792560
