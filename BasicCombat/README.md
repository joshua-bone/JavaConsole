# Basic Combat (Skill Distillery Project, Week 2)
#### By Joshua Bone, 10/17/2016



### Overview
This is a simple text-based game that I created during my second week of coding bootcamp at Skill Distillery. It uses Object Oriented Programming concepts to implement a turn-based combat system with random elements as well as weapon and armor modifiers.

### User Story #1:
The player is prompted to enter their hero's name, and select how many Orcs they think they can fight.

### User Story #2:
The player is presented with a simple text-based menu that describes their options for the given turn.

### User Story #3:
The player may choose an Orc to attack. The damage dealt is selected from a random range of integers based on the weapon the player is holding, but is reduced by a second random integer from a range defined by the armor that the Orc is wearing.

### User Story #4: 
The player may choose to look for armor or weapons instead of attacking, with success based on a random integer such that better armor or weapons are less likely to be found.

### User Story #5:
After the player's turn is complete, each of the Orcs (if still alive) takes a turn, choosing to either attack the player or else look for weapons or armor. 

### User Story #6:
The game ends when either the player dies or else all the Orcs are dead.

##### Notes
Begin the game by running the GameTester class.
