# Blackjack (Skill Distillery Project, Week 3)
#### By Joshua Bone, 10/17/2016



### Overview
This is a text-based, Object-Oriented implementation of the card game 'Blackjack' that I created during my third week of coding bootcamp at Skill Distillery.

### User Story #1:
The player is prompted to enter their name.

### User Story #2:
Cards are dealt to the dealer and player. Player is given the choice to hit, stand, or quit.

### User Story #3:
The player begins the game with a given amount of money. Each round the player's wager is subtracted, and any winnings are added to the total. The game ends if the player's total reaches $0. 

##### Notes
Begin the game by running the BlackjackConsole class.
