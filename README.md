##### Projects by Joshua Bone

### Overview
This repository is home to a number of text-based Java programs that are run entirely from the command line. Many of them were written in 2016 during the first five weeks of my education at [Skill Distillery][sdhomepage], a 16-week immersive coding bootcamp in Denver, Colorado.
